# 3-Flexbox-Pricing-Table-Project
Made this project with the help of FLEXBOX using internal CSS and also used media queries to make it responsive.

-> Uses of a Flexbox Pricing Table Project made with HTML and CSS:
1. Pricing Comparison: A Flexbox Pricing Table allows you to display and compare different pricing plans or packages offered by a business or service. It helps users quickly understand the features, benefits, and costs associated with each option.
2. Visual Organization: With Flexbox, you can create a visually appealing and well-organized pricing table layout. The flexible box model allows you to align and distribute pricing columns and rows dynamically, adjusting to different screen sizes and orientations.
3. Responsive Design: Flexbox makes it easier to create responsive pricing tables that adapt to various devices and screen sizes. This ensures that the table remains readable and user-friendly across different platforms.
4. Flexible Layout: Flexbox provides a powerful and intuitive way to create flexible and adaptive layouts. You can easily adjust the width, height, and positioning of pricing table elements, ensuring consistent alignment and spacing.
5. Browser Compatibility: Flexbox has good browser support, making it a reliable choice for building pricing tables. Most modern browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge, support Flexbox properties and provide consistent rendering.


-> Negatives of a Flexbox Pricing Table Project made with HTML and CSS:
1. Limited Browser Support: Although most modern browsers support Flexbox, some older versions or less common browsers may have partial or limited support. It's crucial to test your pricing table project across different browsers and consider fallback options for unsupported environments.
2. Complexity for Advanced Features: Flexbox is suitable for many common pricing table layouts, but if you need advanced features such as sticky headers, nested tables, or complex interactions, you may need to explore additional CSS techniques or consider using alternative layout methods, like CSS Grid.



-> When working on your Flexbox Pricing Table project, consider the specific requirements and design goals you want to achieve. Flexbox provides a flexible and efficient solution for many pricing table layouts, but it's important to balance your project's needs with browser compatibility and user experience considerations.
